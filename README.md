### Installation

* In CS6, it's possible to run a script by installing it in the proper directory. You simply need to drag and drop the scrip
into the right folder.

For Mac OS this should be in : **$YOUR_ILLUSTRATOR_ROOT_FOLDER/Presets/en_US/**

by selecting from the **"Ctrl+F12"** shortcut.

files will be shrunk or expanded relative to this size.
